Zoura's Simple Crafting is a QOL/Content Plugin that adds basic manufacturing, done via conversation-based UI.

To get started with crafting, you'll need two basic things.
- A factory outfit (currently, there's only one, sold among Deep and Syndicate space) installed aboard your flagship (yes, it has to be your flagship, sorry; engine limitations).
- Raw minerals, mined from asteroids.

From there, you can assemble components. Components are "proper" crafting materials, used to assemble finalized outfits (currently just ammunition). Crafting ammunition is slightly more complicated, as you must have:
- A factory outfit, of course.
- A secondary weapon with ammo that requires crafting.
- And the components necessary to craft the ammo in question.
The UI will show you what you need to craft the ammunition, how much it will make, and how much an instance of the recipe will change your cargo space, however recipes will not appear without a launcher for them equipped somewhere in your fleet.

Be sure to contact me on the Endless Sky Discord (@zoura3025) or post an issue here if you find any problems!
